# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

`This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
We're going to take the following approach:`

- Problem definition
- Data
- Evaluation
- Features
- Modelling
- Experimentation
